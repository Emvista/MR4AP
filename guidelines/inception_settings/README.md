# INCEpTION layers and tagsets

## How to import

The `mr4ap_inception_layers_and_tagsets.zip` archive contains all the necessary items to start annotating MR4AP 
documents with the INCEpTION platform, namely:
* Four layers of annotation (attributes, entities/predicates, relations, and values),
* And the four corresponding tagsets.

To start using them:
* Download the `mr4ap_inception_layers_and_tagsets.zip` file,
* Extract its contents,
* In INCEpTION, go to the *Layers* menu and import each `*_layer.json` file,
* In INCEpTION, go to the *Tagsets* menu and import each `*_tagset.json` file,
* In INCEpTION, go the *Documents* menu and import the documents you want to annotate using the 
*Plain text (one sentence per line)* format (don't forget the asterisks!).

Refer to the [INCEpTION practical guide](../guidelines.md#how-to-inception-a-practical-guide) in the guidelines
for more information regarding the annotation.
